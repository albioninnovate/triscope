## Goals
The goal of this project Is to create a telescope design that will accommodate scaling from small mirror diameters say 100mm to larger diameters of 300 or more.  The strategy is to use a parametric approach in which all the critical dimensions in the design have as root dependencies only a few necessary attributes of the telescope optics and fame materials.

## Design
The telescope is to be transportable. Light weight will be important but not at the expense of stability.  Size will also be important so the ability to collapse the telescope tube will be incorporated.  

Materials and manufacturing tools, where possible will be those available in standard workshops a and makerspace, particular Makespace in Cambridge UK (web.makespace.org).  This design constraint will not extent to the optics at least tin the first iteration.  Grinding a mirror will be considered. 

A further goal of the project is to create a mount that can report the direction of the telescope view to the same precision as the resolving power of the telescope optics.
